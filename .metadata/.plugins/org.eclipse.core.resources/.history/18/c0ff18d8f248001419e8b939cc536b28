1. check if supply is decremented as should
2. Think of the try catches and exceptions that should be included
3. check the get item name implementation
4. Use Sam's formating
5. Test cart methods


Part D : Design Reflections:

/*Differences in the relationships between BulkItem and BulkContainer compared to the relationship 
between Package and ManyPackages */

For the BulkItem and BulkContainer, we see a direct is a relationship where by we explicitly through the 'extends'
keyword that every BulkContainer object also is a BulkItem object.For the Package and ManyPackages we observe a relationship
of composition such that we say , every ManyPackage object 'has a'  Package.

 BulkItem -BulkContainer relationship advantage/disadvantages over ManyPackage -Package relationship:
 
 Advantages:
 
 i) Since a BulkContainer is a BulkItem, a BulkContainer can easily inherit all the  fields and methods (if package access, public or protected)
 of BulkItem. This allows for code reuse. In the ManyPackages-Packages scenario we would need have implementations for each seperately and 
 there is not much code reuse
 
 ii)  The inheritance option allows to easily  add to the functionality of parent class that we would like to be evident in the
child class. So we can basically have something that is BulkItem but behaves differently in its implementation

iii) Inheritance allows us to write even more polymorphic methods, since any method we write that takes a BulkItem as a parameter, can also 
take a BulkContainer in its stead. 


Disadvantages:
